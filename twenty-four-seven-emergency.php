      The Silent Alarm: Why Chest Pain Should Never Be Ignored
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Chest pain is one of those symptoms we often dismiss. “Maybe it’s gas,” “I’m just tired,” or “It’s nothing serious” — these are common excuses. But the truth is, chest pain can be the first sign of a heart attack. Ignoring it can cost precious time, and in cardiac emergencies, every second counts.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      At Nano Hospitals (Hulimavu & Uttarahalli), our 24/7 Cardiac Emergency Unit is designed to act fast. From the moment you walk in, diagnosis and treatment begin in minutes, not hours.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-4">
      Why Speed is Everything in a Heart Attack
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      A heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked, usually by a clot. Without oxygen, the heart muscles start to get damaged within minutes. Doctors emphasize the <strong>Golden Hour</strong> — the first 60 minutes after chest pain starts. Quick treatment during this time can save heart function and lives.
