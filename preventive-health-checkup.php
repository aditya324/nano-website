      In today’s fast-paced world, health often takes a backseat to work, family, and other responsibilities. Many of us feel healthy until symptoms force a visit to the doctor. But what if we could catch potential health issues before they become serious? That’s the power of regular health checkups and preventive care. At Nano Hospitals, we believe that proactive healthcare is the first step towards a longer, healthier life.

      Why Preventive Health Care Is Crucial
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Preventive healthcare is about taking action before a problem arises. While treatments are essential, prevention is always better than cure. Regular health screenings can:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Detect chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorders, or heart diseases early.</li>
      <li>Identify lifestyle-related risks such as obesity, high cholesterol, and fatty liver.</li>
      <li>Reduce the risk of complications by starting timely interventions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Studies show that patients who undergo annual health checkups have a significantly lower risk of severe illnesses because early detection allows timely lifestyle changes and treatment.

      Common Lifestyle Diseases in Bengaluru
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Urban lifestyles have introduced several health challenges. The most common lifestyle diseases include:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Diabetes (Type 2)</strong> – Often silent until complications like neuropathy or vision problems appear.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</strong> – Can lead to heart attacks or strokes if unmanaged.</li>
      <li><strong>Thyroid Disorders</strong> – Affects metabolism, energy levels, and weight.</li>
      <li><strong>Obesity</strong> – Affects heart health, joints, and increases diabetes risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Heart Diseases</strong> – Includes high cholesterol, blocked arteries, and arrhythmias.</li>

    </ul>
