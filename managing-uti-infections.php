      Understanding Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      UTIs, commonly known as bladder infections, occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract and multiply. This leads to inflammation and discomfort in the bladder, urethra, or kidneys.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Symptoms of UTIs include painful urination, frequent urination, cloudy or bloody urine, and sometimes fever.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-4">
      Causes of UTIs in Summer
    </h2>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 space-y-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Dehydration:</strong> Higher temperatures and increased outdoor activities can lead to dehydration, concentrating urine and promoting bacterial growth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Humidity:</strong> Warm, humid weather creates conditions conducive to bacterial proliferation, especially in intimate areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Changes in Lifestyle:</strong> Swimming or wearing damp clothing for extended periods increases bacterial contamination risk.
      </li>
    </ol>
