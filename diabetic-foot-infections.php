                Diabetic foot infections are a common and serious complication of diabetes that can lead to severe medical problems if left untreated. People with diabetes are more prone to foot infections due to nerve damage, poor blood circulation, and weakened immune systems.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-8">
                These infections can range from mild skin conditions to severe, limb-threatening infections. They may be caused by bacteria, fungi, or, in rare cases, viruses.

                    <strong>Cellulitis:</strong> A bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues that causes redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. If untreated, it can spread rapidly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Osteomyelitis:</strong> A serious bone infection that occurs when bacteria enter the bone through a wound or ulcer. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling, fever, and delayed wound healing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Necrotizing Fasciitis:</strong> A rare but life-threatening bacterial infection affecting soft tissues. It causes rapid tissue damage and often requires urgent surgery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fungal Infections:</strong> Conditions such as athlete’s foot are more common in people with diabetes and can worsen if not treated promptly.

                Why Diabetic Foot Infections Are Dangerous
            </h2>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Diabetic foot infections can progress quickly due to reduced sensation and poor healing. Minor cuts or blisters may go unnoticed and become infected.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-8">
                If not treated early, these infections can lead to serious complications such as foot ulcers, gangrene, and even amputation.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-1">

            <p>
                Diabetic foot infections are serious but largely preventable with proper foot care, early detection, and timely medical treatment. By staying vigilant and seeking professional care at the first sign of infection, people with diabetes can significantly reduce the risk of complications and protect their mobility and quality of life.
